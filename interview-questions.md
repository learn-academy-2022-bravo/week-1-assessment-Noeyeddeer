# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: git is a file sharing system which allows for code sharing between different computers, either local to local or local to host. Github is a remote hosting space for code that is pushed over git, whereas git is just the code enabling the communication of code between local machine and remote site.

  Researched answer: git is a version control system in wide use amongst programmers. It was created by Linus Torvalds to track changes in source code. Whereas git is a version control system, Github is a cloud-based hosting service used which was designed as a git repository for primarily programming use.



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: The Javascript operators =, ==, ===, <, >, etc will return Boolean values. Booleans are binary values of true and false that can be used when you need to return a value based on whether a certain condition is met or not.

  Researched answer: Javascript operators that will return a Boolean value are equality operators (==, ===), relational operators (>, <, >=, <=), and logical operators (and(&&), or(||), not(//)).



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is a value corresponding to a logical ordered space within a string or array. Indexes start at 0 and proceed from there, so the index of the letter "e" in the string "Hello" would be 1. A value is the actual number, string, boolean, etc which occupies a space at a certain index. In our previous example, "e" is the value and 1 is the index.

  Researched answer: Not sure how I can paraphrase this one any further, I pretty much nailed it above ^.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is the repeating of a particular piece of code through a string, array, etc until a certain condition has been met. Iteration is usually accomplished with a for loop.

  Researched answer: The only thing I'll add here is that you can iterate until a certain condition is met OR a certain number of times.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: One person is the driver and the other is the navigator. The driver is actively coding and taking direction and input from the navigator. The navigator is not actively coding and is directing the code inputs of the driver as well as directing the troubleshooting of any errors.

  Researched answer: Crushed this one too, see above ^.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A higher order function takes in another function as an argument or returns another function as an output. The distinction between this and a normal function is that a normal function takes a value or variable as an argument and outputs the result of that value or variable when passed through the function.

2. Jest: Jest is a JavaScript testing framework which uses slightly different methods than normal JavaScript. These methods define what the different elements of the code are expected to do and the output is generally more detailed in terms of error identification.

3. Objects: Objects are key:value pairs that can assign many values to the same variable.

4. Method: Methods are actions that can be performed on objects. An example of a method would be the .toUpperCase() method that we are already familiar with.

5. Classes: A class is a template for JavaScript objects. It designates what kind of value a key should correspond to in an object.
